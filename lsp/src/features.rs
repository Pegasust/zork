//! The features module would be responsible for implementing the various LSP 
//! features, like hover, completion, formatting, etc. Each feature would 
//! have access to the current document state from the document module and the 
//! parsed markdown from the parser module. Each feature can be implemented as 
//! a separate function or struct that takes in the necessary context and 
//! returns a response to be sent back to the client.
